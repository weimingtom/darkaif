//===============================================
// THIS IS "AS-IS" CODED.
//===============================================

Information: 
	This is on going build to deal basic game play. This for RTS
builds. There are two type of game play. Space and ground battle builds. 
This section will explain on going work about flash engines current build.
This on basic build and coding class and functions.

This is a working build code for rts game.
//===============================================
// Away3D:
//===============================================

-PROS:
 * Working build files
 * Nice bend with over lap objects. That is needed for game build test.
 * Select functions for 3D Select Box.
 * Ray Casting 2D to 3D.
 * Control depth for z sorting.

-CONS:
 * Ray casting need to fix some how. Offset from camrea.

//===============================================
// Sandy3D:
//===============================================

-PROS:
 * Working build files
 * matrix math
 * Select functions for 3D Select Box.
 * Ray Casting 2D to 3D.
 * Control depth for z sorting.
 * 2D Collision ploygon.

-CONS:
 * Render clipping and over object not working out well.
 * Support only one light.
 
//===============================================
// Papervision3D:
//===============================================

-PROS:
 * Working build files
 * Mouse3D will listen every object mesh point position
 * It has nice blend.

-CONS:
 * Clipping on the plane for basic build box.
 * Tricky in some coding mesh build for material is some time null error.
 * Polygon point position
 * plane default not fixed to only x,z axis
 
///==============================================
// 3D Engines:
//===============================================

-PROS:
 * It bit easy to learn for the basic build.

-CONS:
 * Game build for beginer is bit hard that depend the build.
 * Not easy to get matrix math code to work. Do more home to able to get object face direction working.
 * Tons of reseach.
 * Polygon limited.
 * no polygon collision or intersect
 
 
 Note: There might be different build that depend on the class build on the engine.
