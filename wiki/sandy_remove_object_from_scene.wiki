{{{
public var scene:Scene3D;
public var camera:Camera3D;
public var g:Group = new Group("myGroup");

var objectmove:Array = g.children
			for (var c:int = 0; c < objectmove.length; c++) {
				//trace('object:' + objectmove[c].name);
				if (objectmove[c].name != '1') {//default there should be a camera (It should be number one (1) and not a letter l ='L')
					//trace('object remove-:' + objectmove[c].name);
					g.removeChildByName(objectmove[c].name);
				}
			}
