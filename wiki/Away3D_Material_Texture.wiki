= Introduction =
   Here you will able to learn how to use image to apply to the polygon skin. I coded the simple parts to understand how code works.  But each class object might be different. That depends on the object format.

Materials:
 * http://darkaif.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/darkaif/engine3d/away3d/Away3DPlaneTextureLoader.as

This is just the basic texture loading.

 * http://darkaif.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/darkaif/engine3d/away3d/Away3DPlaneTextureUrlLoader.as

This is just the basic texture loading.

There are different methods of loading files. That you have to sreach around for better object file management.

This is a sprite apply to the polygon. Simple stuff to make.

 * http://code.google.com/p/darkaif/source/browse/trunk/darkaif/engine3d/away3d/Away3DPlaneSpriteButton.as

This is interacting button into the 3D plane. You can able to apply anything that is sprite class base. But remember the drag function might not work out well. You can create buttons and menus as long is sprite class. To apply it as skin, convert into movie material class.
