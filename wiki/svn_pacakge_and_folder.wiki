= Introduction =
   If you new here, please learn little bit of the folder and package. The folders hold the main code that doesn't need package folder. Package folder is like a parent code and child that branch it off. But do the engine search you find out more than me.

Work Area:
 * http://darkaif.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/darkaif/src/

Files:
 * http://darkaif.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/darkaif/data/

Packages:
 * http://darkaif.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/darkaif/src/darkaif/
 * http://darkaif.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/darkaif/src/darknet/

Those packages are bit stable and there are some or more example in programs packages.

Note that I may miss some code and recode them later. There are other packages that required them to be working together.
