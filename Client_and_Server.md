# Information: #
> There are pros and cons for making flash games for online. Going to talk about the basic about them. I done some research from reading forums and looking at some example. There are some simple language code and easy for user who want to create a simple game. But keep it simple and your goal else you go off topic.

Which is easy to code for server build?

Well it depend on your skills. I would chose the most simple language code to build. I would chose java script.

List of code:
  * Java (easy to build [IDE easy to work with](Free.md))
  * Python (easy base)
  * C# (not sure [IDE easy to work with](Free.md))
  * C/C++ (not easy/ heavy setup)
  * etc(it depends on language code)

You have to chose what method to code and what support what code to able to build. Doing the research is important. There different coding and different method and layer complex support.

What you need to build a game server over web browser:
  * what your target people? (kids, teens, adults)
  * Is this social club chat?
  * Free/ premium / month fees /ads? (note server maintains and host cost)
  * What your goals? (skills,fun,learning,etc...)?
  * Quick build? (This part you should not rush it your project it will come back to haunt you.)
  * web page and design flow?
  * Theme of game or communicates.
  * Do you have time to build this? Alone or with the group (free or pay)?
  * Plan ahead and what your time to finish peace of your code or content build?
  * Are you going to able to use php,as3, java, html, tags,etc.
  * Is your site easy to understand?
  * User custom build work (This take a lot time from coders a bit).
  * Are you using Forums or Custom forums to add on from flash game credits.
  * Are you using wiki for this site?
  * Think small and then add on if you have skills.
  * Think big it will take longer if your noob and might required a team.
  * What skills level are you at? (coding languages,art,3D model,story,plot,etc...)
  * Are you using MYSQL for site? (support from php,java,etc... as long it has plug-in or ext.)


# Flash Client and Server Actionscript3: #
> It is possible to make a client and server. But you can’t save data. It the sandbox.

Pro:
  * You can save part of the data from flash setting but it temporary.
  * use socket binary and xml.

Con:
  * Can’t save anything.(sand box)
  * It has no listen to allow multi connection.(You need be better at coding to know how to do multi connection)

# Flash Client (Actionscript3) and Server (php): #

Pro:
  * create script to load and save data to mysql.
  * you could create a script that can run from your own computer but not on the web page.(advance user)
  * simple and easy to learn php.
  * php can become xml if script is execute actions query.

Con:
  * not real time when script are execute from the host site like web page.
  * required to host to able to use php scripts.
  * Link your script to the actionscript url request.

# Flash Client (Actionscript3) and Server (Java): #

Pro:
  * use the sockets xml and binary.
  * both are almost same way it is package style but way to code.
  * There are easy IDE for quick build for display graphic menu and panels.
  * socket xml is easy and light weight to for easy games.
  * It can work both ways that depend how well is your java sockets and actionscript3.

Con:
  * you have to learn java and Actionscript 3 at the same time.
  * database you need to setup
  * build application
  * socket binary might be bit harder to java server that you need to know how to code. Java is bit easy than C++. Java is easy to code and able to build quickly but takes time.
  * You have to learn how to thread to able to use a server.
  * If you have 3D engine stuff you got to have game engine that is same is that or equal to make the java server do the work.
  * Convert physic to as3 to java that depend on the coding.

# Flash Client (Actionscript3) and Server (Python): #

Pro:
  * use the sockets
  * you can create sqlite simple built from python.
  * it easy to use once you know some basic if you read the stuff online.
  * Python has it own GUI. Basic menus and buttons.

Con:
  * you have to learn Python and Actionscript 3 at the same time.
  * spacing is important in python.
  * Learn to packages files in python it is bit hard to understand a bit. Even for the noobs. This part you have to read it carefully about how to make packages and classes.
  * If you have 3D engine stuff you got to have game engine that is same is that or equal to make the java server do the work.
  * Convert AS3 to python for physic and other code might be easy and hard same time.

# Flash Client (Actionscript3) and Server (Other): #

Pro:
  * It depend if it use the sockets in binary or xml.
  * Custom making your own can improve the server status or not that depend how well code it.

Con:
  * You have to write policy access to the flash when it goes live. If your testing it just the swf file or local network it will not show up. That depends what program are you using.
  * You have learn the other code to able to make a server.
  * If your using the flash engine be sure you know that you code it different.
  * Research does take time out you.
  * Making multi client to connect to the server. Need to learn it but it can be simple some language code once you seen it.
  * If you have 3D or Physic engine on flash you need those part in the java too for server work load. ( But there are many ways to code.)
  * If your using for multilayer with heavy build use binary coding not xml. It will increase your byte size that will lag.

Tips: Read and research will save time in building the game. If you understand the language in basic code.
