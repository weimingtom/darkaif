Notice: There are some file working but it in the early stage.

# Information: #
This is a role playing game and real time strategy flash game that is coded in AS3 (Actionscript 3) and written in OOP (Object-Oriented Programming). The game will be build in parts. This game will be using free software and other open source codes for developing the game. AS long you can give credit to me and other other who has support the game code.

The game structures will have simple builds and simple formats for user to understand. User can custom build their own objects, that is under going build. Coding each part in my to do list. Better way to manage them a bit.

I am working on stand alone version and hosting builds. It required a host site to able to save data and load them in different format. Working on local and host location directory that is for converting back and forward. The game will be later build for client and server in real time interacting with other players.

Basic Goals:
  * RPG game:(Work In Progress) 11%
  * RTS game:(Work In Progress) 9%
  * AI Build (Work In Progress) 2% (tricky and hard)
  * Server/Client Networking(work in progress)1%
  * Web Interface (work in progress) 11% (basic interface)
  * Game Structure/Engine/Editor (work in progress) 13%
Those goals are not easy to do but doing one at the time will save work with less errors. The percent is just a guess. There will be demos when adding them on.
